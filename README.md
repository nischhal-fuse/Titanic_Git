# Titanic Data Exploration & Survival Prediction 

[cite_start]This project explores the classic Titanic dataset to uncover patterns influencing passenger survival through data analysis and visualization[cite: 13, 14]. [cite_start]It applies machine learning models to predict survival outcomes based on historical passenger data[cite: 17].
